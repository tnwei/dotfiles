Custom themes for rofi.

`rofi-theme-selector` looks for `themes/` in this directory aside from the bundled ones in `/usr/share/rofi/themes/`.

Added some from https://github.com/yuky2020/rofi-themes: carbonized and cherry

squared-nord came from https://github.com/lr-tech/rofi-themes-collection. Ended up going with a modified version of this. Rofi font is set here..
